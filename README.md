# ThreadMark – A Contextual Bookmarking App

## Overview:
ThreadMark is an innovative bookmarking app that helps users save and categorize key takeaways from online articles, books, podcasts, and conversations. Instead of just saving links, users can capture contextual highlights with tags and timestamps, making it easier to revisit and build knowledge over time.

## Core Features (MVP - Week 1 Scope)
Threaded Bookmarks – Users can save text snippets, URLs, or personal notes as contextual bookmarks with categories (e.g., "Tech Reads," "Career Advice").
Tag & Recall System – Users can assign custom tags and later search or filter by them (e.g., “SwiftUI,” “Leadership,” “Startups”).

## Scalability & Future Expansion
Automated Context – Use NLP (CoreML later) to auto-tag based on content.
Cloud Syncing – Enable iCloud sync for multi-device access.
Collaborative Sharing – Allow users to share bookmark threads with annotations.
Podcast Mode – Enable users to save timestamps & highlights from Apple Podcasts.

## Why This App?
✅ Unique Angle: Not just a bookmark manager—it structures knowledge like a personal knowledge graph.
✅ Scalable Foundation: Starts simple (save & tag) but grows into a powerful research assistant.
✅ Resume-Ready Tech Stack: SwiftUI + CoreData (later CloudKit, NLP, and even widgets).
✅ Demonstrates Key iOS Skills: State management, data persistence, filtering/search, and UI interactions.
